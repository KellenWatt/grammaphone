# Grammaphone
A BNF grammar-based parser.

No, it isn't spelled wrong. Grammaphone is a parser based strictly on the idea 
of parsing strictly based on a grammar, and not having any sort of intermediate 
generation. This is significantly slower than generated parsers, but also 
simpler to inject in a toolchain.
